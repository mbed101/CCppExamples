Creational patterns:

Abstract Factory
Builder
Factory Method
Prototype
Singleton
Structural patterns:

Adapter
Bridge
Composite
Decorator
Facade
Flyweight
Proxy
Behavioral patterns:

Chain of Responsibility
Command
Interpreter
Iterator
Mediator
Memento
Observer
State
Strategy
Template Method
Visitor

These design patterns can be used to solve various programming problems in a structured and modular way. Each pattern has its own set of characteristics and can be used in different situations. It's worth noting that not every pattern is appropriate for every problem, so it's important to choose the right pattern(s) for your specific situation




## Other answer

Singleton: A class with only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

Factory: A method for creating objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created.

Observer: A pattern in which objects receive notifications when the state of other objects changes.

Decorator: A pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

Adapter: A pattern that adapts an interface to another one that a client is expecting.

Command: A pattern that decouples objects that invoke operations from the objects that perform these operations.

Abstract Factory: A pattern for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Builder: A pattern for constructing complex objects step by step.

Prototype: A pattern for creating objects by cloning an existing object.

Facade: A pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex system.
